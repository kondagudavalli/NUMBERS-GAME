# 🔢 Counter Application (JavaScript Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **simple Counter Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The app demonstrates **DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic UI updates** in JavaScript.  

Users can:
- Increment the counter by `+1`
- Decrement the counter by `-1` (restricted to not go below `0`)
- Increment the counter by `+5`
- Decrement the counter by `-5` (restricted to not go below `0`)

Additionally, a **message below the counter** updates dynamically to show the performed action.

---

## 🖥️ Output (Working of App)
- Displays a counter starting at `0`.  
- Four buttons allow the user to modify the counter value:
  1. **Increment** → Increases count by 1  
  2. **Decrement** → Decreases count by 1  
  3. **Increment By 5** → Increases count by 5  
  4. **Decrement By 5** → Decreases count by 5  
- A text message below the counter indicates the action (e.g., "Increasing one by one...").  
- Counter will **not go negative** (validation included).

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** → For structuring the web page  
- **CSS3** → For styling buttons, background, and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** → For interactivity and event handling

│── index.html # Structure of the app
│── style.css # Styling (buttons, layout, background)
│── script.js # Functionality (counter logic, event listeners)

## 🧑‍💻 JavaScript Features Used
- **DOM Manipulation** (`getElementById`, `textContent`)  
- **Event Listeners** (`addEventListener` for button clicks)  
- **Functions** (reusable `op()` function for UI updates)  
- **Conditional Logic** (restricting decrement below zero)  

---

## 🎨 Styling (CSS Highlights)
- Buttons styled with:
  - Blue background and white text  
  - Hover effect with darker shade  
  - Padding and border-radius for better UI  
- Layout centered using **Flexbox**  
- Counter text enlarged (`60px font-size`) for visibility  
- Light background (`antiquewhite`) for a clean look

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/counter-app.git


## 📂 File Structure

Open index.html in your browser.
Click buttons to interact with the counter.
===========================================
✅ Learning Outcomes

By building this project, you learn:

How to handle events in JavaScript

Updating UI dynamically using DOM properties

Using functions for clean code

Implementing basic validation (preventing negative values)

Writing a clean and structured README for GitHub projects

## 📸 Sample UI (Expected Output)
----------------------------------
Counter: 0

[ Increment ] [ Decrement ] [ Increment By 5 ] [ Decrement By 5 ]

Message: "Action performed..."
